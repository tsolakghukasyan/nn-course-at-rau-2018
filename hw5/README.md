### HW5. Fine-tuning VGG16

In this task, VGG16 with weights pre-trained on ImageNet is fine-tuned to recognize characters from the Simpsons animated series.

For training and evaluation, a subset of [the Simpsons Character Data](https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset) is used.
The final model is trained and validated on 1800 images of 2 two characters, and achieves 73% accuracy on 200 test images.
